I didn't read any tutorial/instruction and just started to write my intents according to the figure, and Lumi was able to map correctly everything that I wrote. Congratulations for the work! Can the Lumi provide an interface for expert users where they can see the ""command line"" that was generated by interacting with a chatbot? Maybe such information can be useful for operators to create their own scripts/knows what is really happening in the network, thus providing more flexibility and transparency for expert users while simplifying and hiding complexities for the non-technical users. 

P.S: That will be very nice if you make available an API of Lumi to allow the integration of Lumi with different management tools that are available or being developed by third-parties. I would like, for example, to make a call to Lumi in order to receive the command to create a specific rule on a Firewall being deployed.

I am looking forward to seeing that published on SIGCOMM! #UFRGS #MiguelQu√¢ntico #PurinhoDosBot"
