Students data limit is 100 GB per week
The system passively monitors the network throughput when traffic is light
There is a 6 GB per 24-hour period upload or download data transfer limit starting at midnight of each day, on all of your combined traffic on ResNet and UIC wireless
Guests cannot run any file sharing/downloading program
No individual service or system running on the wired/wireless network should use more than 10 gigabytes of per day, regardless of whether it is inbound or outbound over the commodity network link
The system will trigger an overuse notification if the average for either inbound or outbound usage exceeds 10 GB per week
Quotas for students are 5000 Megabyte per hr download and 2000 Megabyte per hr upload
Routers or anything else that does routing or NAT are prohibited from MITNet as they interfere with the operation of the network
The individual will have a 4 Mbps bandwidth rate limit
You may not run FTP, telnet, peer-to-peer, HTTP, IRC, DNS and mail servers on ResNet or UIC wireless-connected devices
Students have 200 GB of Free monthly usage
Faculty members have 500 Gb per week of free network use
Students have a quota of 5 GB per day The quota is reset at 6am
Internet is limited to 3 Mbps per host
P2P application is separately capped at 30 Mbps for the entire campus
Guests' network is rate-limited to 5 Mb/s per user
The ResNet cap is currently 200 gigabytes per each 7 day period of combined incoming and outgoing traffic
These network security changes include blocking traffic from the Internet into the UW network over FTP
Elements of network security currently include the following four solutions: Network Border Infrastructure System, Intrusion Prevention System, Firewalls and Custom Unit Firewalls
ACT/IT Infrastructure monitors traffic on the network for the purpose of maintaining proper network function
CIS restricts traffic that is known to cause damage to the network or hosts on it, such as NETBIOS
All network traffic passing in or out of Brown's network is monitored by intrusion detection system for signs of compromises
You may not run any services (e.g., FTP services,listservers,P2P file sharing servers, publishing files via generic file services, etc.) via ResNet or NYURoam wireless networks
Housing does not normally limit the amount of bandwidth
The UVA More Secure Network uses a firewall, a network security device designed to help protect your computer from hackers and other malicious people on the Internet.
The network firewall does prevent some applications from working in their normal manner, for example, video and audio conferencing products that use the H.323
The UC Davis network is continually scanned for prohibited activities and network threats.
