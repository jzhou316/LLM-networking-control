Unfortunately, your configuration remains incorrect. We used PYANG to verify the syntax, schema, and constraints satisfaction of your proposed configuration. Using this feedback, please revise your initial translation. Assume that your proposed configuration was not implemented, i.e. you are working with the original network state. You should follow the same rules from the original task: generate the YANG ABNF json changes needed to perform the specific configuration given by the operator, using the given knowledge about the current configuration of the devices. Notice in the example that your actions are limited only to append and remove operations (NO UPDATES OR SETS PLEASE), and that the changes are given as paths. Your list should be expressed in Python syntax and clearly delineated so that it can be automatically extracted. Please also separate the configurations for different devices explicitly and provide a brief explanation of your translation.
